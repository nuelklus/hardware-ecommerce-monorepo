# Hardware E-commerce Project Rules (Monorepo)

## Stack (Non-Negotiable)
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router)
- Backend: Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

## Regional Defaults (Non-Negotiable)
- Default currency: GHS
- Default phone country code: +233

## Architecture Rules
- Use a Service Layer pattern.
- Place business logic in services.py (or service modules), NOT in views.py.
- Views should only: validate input, call services, serialize responses.

## Domain Requirements
- Must include a JobSite model for deliveries.
- Must support a Pro-Contractor user role for bulk pricing.

## Repo Structure
- backend/: Django + DRF project
- frontend/: Next.js app

## Notes
- Do not introduce alternative stacks (e.g., FastAPI, Express) without explicit approval.
